# pothole-detection-yolo
Real-time pothole detection system using a custom YOLOv8 model trained on Roboflow and deployed with OpenCV. The system captures webcam feed, detects potholes with bounding boxes, and uses SSIM similarity filtering to avoid duplicate image logging. Includes Colab notebook for model training, best.pt weights, and Python inference scripts.

This project implements a **real-time pothole detection system** using a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model**.  
The system captures webcam video, detects potholes, draws bounding boxes, and automatically saves **only unique pothole frames** using SSIM similarity filtering.

🚧 Designed for smart city applications, road-safety automation & AI-powered infrastructure monitoring.
